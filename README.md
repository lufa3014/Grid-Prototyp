# G.R.I.D. – Strategy/Tactics Game in Unity

This project was developed at FH Wedel as part of the **Game Design Project** module.

A 3D single-player strategy/tactics game prototype built in Unity, focusing on game balance, visual clarity, and technical extensibility.
The concept and gameplay were inspired by games like **Plants vs. Zombies** and **Pokémon**.

> **Note:** This repository only contains the Unity build, not the source code.
